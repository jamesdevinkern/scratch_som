# scratch_som
My implementation of a self-organizing map algorithm from scratch.

I utilized this implementation to tackle a work problem and solidify some C++ knowledge. I would usually default to using Python, but surprisingly there are not many SOM libraries available. 

Results from the analysis I applied this to are used prolifically in our work division. Those results are not shared.

Thanks,

James
